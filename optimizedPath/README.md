## Possible improvments 
Creating a GUI was the primary reason in creating this program, until now I have never made a GUI. But because of this I had encountered a couple of issues such as the allowing for the communication between components, the solution that is currently being used is getters connected from the root panel. This should be changed since it violates encapsulation and is overall dangerous. Instead the majority of functionality should be moved to the display class so that the two component getters are not needed. Other classes can also benefit from removing getters and setters.
